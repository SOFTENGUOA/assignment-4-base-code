 * You must stage, commit and push your changes everytime you are 
 * "done" (see the "definition of done" in Agile/Scrum/XP) with writing/changing this class, i.e. 
 * after successfully completing task 1, task 2 and task 3, respectively
 * DO NOT COMMIT and PUSH prematurely i.e. before each task is completed.
